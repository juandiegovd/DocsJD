# Design Patterns

Someone has already solved your problems

Provide a shared language for a development team

The one constant in software development is **CHANGE**

## OO Basics
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation: Bundling related data into a structured unit
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles
- Encapsulate what varies:
  - Separate what changes from what stays the same
  - So it won't affect the rest of your code resulting in risks from code changes
- Favor composition over inheritance
  - Composition: HAS A ->
  - Inheritance: IS A --->
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
  - Stop depending on concretes
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact (Observer)
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification (Decorator)
